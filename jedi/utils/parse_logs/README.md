`parse_logs` defines functionality to parse updated logs that differentiate between warnings and errors, and dumps data in json format. Running this script on a directory produces two dataframes of warnings and errors respectively.

Usage:
```
rpdr/utils/parse_logs/parse_logs.py --log_dir [PATH TO LOG DIRECTORY] --output_dir [PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY]
```
